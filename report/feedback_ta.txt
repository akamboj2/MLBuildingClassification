Title: somehow indicate buidling classification.

Abstract:
- more detail mention project of building classification not just ml stuff

Introduction: also describe more about the 3 separate tasks.

Data collection
- if data collection was a big part of your project, write more about it, make it a bigger section. The whole paper is 4 pages
- add images of your sample data and labels.

Results:
- make sure to talk about the training and the models enough,
just talking about the datasize makes your project seem more trivial then it actually is
because it is kind of obvious that with more data the models will perform better.
- when talking about the data size and data,
make sure you have a specific measure like recall =  true positives / total positives(which is true positves + false negatives))
or precision = true positive / (true positves + false positives). https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%A9cision_et_rappel
